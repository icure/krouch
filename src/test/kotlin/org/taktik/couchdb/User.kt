/**
 * A User
 * This entity is a root level object. It represents an user that can log in to the iCure platform. It is serialized in JSON and saved in the underlying icure-base CouchDB database.
 * A User conforms to a series of interfaces:
 * - StoredDocument
 * - Principal
 *
 * @property id the Id of the user. We encourage using either a v4 UUID or a HL7 Id.
 * @property rev the revision of the user in the database, used for conflict management / optimistic locking.
 * @property created the timestamp (unix epoch in ms) of creation of the user, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @property deletionDate hard delete (unix epoch in ms) timestamp of the object. Filled automatically when user is deleted.
 * @property name Last name of the user. This is the official last name that should be used for official administrative purposes.
 * @property properties Extra properties for the user. Those properties are typed (see class Property)
 * @property roles Roles specified for the user
 * @property permissions If permission to modify patient data is granted or revoked
 * @property type Authorization source for user. 'Database', 'ldap' or 'token'
 * @property status State of user's activeness: 'Active', 'Disabled' or 'Registering'
 * @property login Username for this user. We encourage using an email address
 * @property passwordHash Hashed version of the password (BCrypt is used for hashing)
 * @property secret Secret token used to verify 2fa
 * @property use2fa Whether the user has activated two factors authentication
 * @property groupId id of the group (practice/hospital) the user is member of
 * @property healthcarePartyId Id of the healthcare party if the user is a healthcare party.
 * @property patientId Id of the patient if the user is a patient
 * @property autoDelegations Delegations that are automatically generated client side when a new database object is created by this user
 * @property createdDate the timestamp (unix epoch in ms) of creation of the user, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @property lastLoginDate the timestamp (unix epoch in ms) of last login of the user.
 * @property termsOfUseDate the timestamp (unix epoch in ms) of the latest validation of the terms of use of the application
 * @property email email address of the user.
 * @property applicationTokens Deprecated : Use authenticationTokens instead - Long lived authentication tokens used for inter-applications authentication
 * @property authenticationTokens Encrypted and time-limited Authentication tokens used for inter-applications authentication
